# independent-mc
A tool to download and run minecraft fully portable on all Windows computers. Uses portablemc for python as basis.

## How to use
*First of all: You need to have python installed!*  
*If your python executable is on path and the script still does not work, consider upgrading python and/or pip.*  

Download the three files from the repo into the directory you want to install Minecraft to. That might also be a removable drive.  
If you want, adjust the version settings in the `download.bat` file.  
Also, add or remove mods to or from the `mods.txt` file.
Then execute it by double-clicking. The script now does everything for you.  

Once finished, you should have a `start.bat` file to start the game.  

**Happy gaming!**

## Issues
If you encounter any issues, try to fix them on their own first.  
Then open an issue here and if you have, describe the solution.

## Contributing
Contributing is not wanted. This script is meant to work as-is.  
I only published it to not gatekeep the idea and structure of the code.  
If you want alpha and beta versions to be included, missing dependency versions to be handled in a better way etc. you can of course style the script to your needs.
